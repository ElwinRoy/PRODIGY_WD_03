Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! This repository hosts a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a responsive design, allowing players to enjoy it on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. To start the game, simply click on the "Start Game" button, and Player X will begin the match. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their marks (X or O) and aim to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game. The game automatically detects when a player wins or if it's a draw. If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.
